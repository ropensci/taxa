Title: Taxonomic Classes
Description: Provides taxonomic classes for
    groupings of taxonomic names without data, and those
    with data. Methods provided are "taxonomically aware", in
    that they know about ordering of ranks, and methods that
    filter based on taxonomy also filter associated data. 
    This package is described in the publication: "Taxa: An R 
    package implementing data standards and methods for 
    taxonomic data", Zachary S.L. Foster, Scott Chamberlain,  
    Niklaus J. Gr√ºnwald (2018) <doi:10.12688/f1000research.14013.2>.
