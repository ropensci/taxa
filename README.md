# taxa

[![Project Status: WIP - Initial development is in progress, but there
has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the
public.](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/)
[![cran
version](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/taxa)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=taxa)

This is an R package that provides classes to store and manipulate
taxonomic data. Most of the classes can be used like base R vectors.
This project is a partial rewrite of the previous version of `taxa` and
is currently under development.

**A note about recent changes:**

This is beginning of a complete rewrite of the previous `taxa` package
to make the more basic component classes more like base R vectors. The
`taxmap` class is not yet reimplemented, but will be similar to the
class in the previous versions of taxa. The old version of `taxa` has
been incorporated into the `metacoder` package until this version of
taxa is mature, at which time `metacoder` will also use this version.
